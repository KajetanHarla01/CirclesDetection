<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This script is designed to detect and count circular pieces in thermographic images. It uses image processing techniques such as contour detection and circularity measurement to identify complete circles. 
The results are visualized and saved for further analysis.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul><li>Detects and quantifies circular objects in thermographic images.</li>
<li>Displays the original and processed images side by side for easy visualization.</li>
<li>Saves the output image with detected circles to a specified directory.</li></ul>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
The following Python libraries are required to run the script:
<ul><li><b>OpenCV</b>: For image processing operations.</li>
<li><b>NumPy</b>: For numerical operations on image data.</li>
<li><b>Matplotlib</b>: For displaying and saving results.</li></ul>

Install the required libraries using:
<code>pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib</code>
